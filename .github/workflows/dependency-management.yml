          ## 🔧 Automated Dependency Updates
          
          This PR contains automated dependency updates focusing on:
          - 🔒 Security vulnerability fixes
          - 📦 Maintenance updates for stability
          - 🏛️ Government compliance considerations
          
          ### Changes Made
          - Updated npm dependencies to latest secure versions
          - Applied security patches where available
          - Maintained compatibility with existing APIs
          
          ### ⚠️ Testing Instructions
          **Important**: Automated PRs may not trigger CI workflows automatically.
          
          **To validate this PR:**
          1. **Manual CI Trigger**: Comment `/test` or push an empty commit to trigger workflows
          2. **Local Testing**: Clone the branch and run `npm test` locally
          3. **Example Verification**: Test all example files work correctly
          
          **Command to test locally:**
          ```bash
          git fetch origin automated-dependency-updates
          git checkout automated-dependency-updates
          npm ci
          npm test
          npm run build
          node examples/basic-usage.js
          ```
          
          ### Government Agency Review
          Before merging, please ensure:
          - [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes (trigger manually if needed)
          - [ ] Changes align with agency security policies
          - [ ] No breaking changes affect existing integrations
          - [ ] Updated dependencies are approved for government use
          - [ ] Security scanning passes all checks
          
          ### Testing Required
          - [ ] All existing tests pass
          - [ ] Security scans show no new vulnerabilities
          - [ ] Build process completes successfully
          - [ ] Examples still function correctly
